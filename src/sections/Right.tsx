                <p>I am a <b>Frontend Developer</b> with a B.Sc in Computer Science, passionate about crafting <b>intuitive, responsive,</b> and <b>scalable</b> applications. I specialize in modern tools like <b>JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, Motion</b> for sleek user interfaces, <b>TailwindCSS</b> for streamlined styling, and <b>Redux Toolkit</b> for seamless state management when not using ReactJs's <b>Context API</b>. I have also worked with <b>Supabase</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> to integrate robust backend solutions that elevate frontend performance. 
                <br /><br />
                My goal? Build user-focused experiences that solve real-world problems while keeping code clean and efficient. I am also open to <b>remote work</b> opportunities and thrive on continuous learning to stay updated on the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
